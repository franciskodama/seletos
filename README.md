### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! ðŸ‘‹

## WELCOME TO MY SELETOS WEBSITE PROJECT. ðŸ‘»

<hr />

# this.Project ðŸ“–

This was the first website that I fully developed with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Why?

Customizing template websites was already something I knew how to do. Now, it was time to build a website from scratch.
</br>
</br>

## How?

After finding a client and receiving a briefing, I used my experience in digital marketing to design and code the entire website.
</br>
</br>

## What?

The key features of the project were Flexbox, Display Grid, some simple animations, and Responsiveness in general.
